#Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
#you can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements
#into any other data structure. The stack supports the following operations:
#push, pop, peek, and isEmpty

from dataStructures import stack


#not done yet
##def sortStack(stack1):
##    temp = stack()
##    temp.push(stack1.pop())
##    while not stack1.isEmpty
